**Tautology**: A compound proposition that is always true no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it.
	Example: 
			Consider the truth table of p ∨ p ¬. Because p ∨ p ¬ is always true, it is a tautology.

**Contradiction**:  A compound proposition that is always false is called a contradiction
	**Example**: Consider the truth table of p ∧ ¬p. Because p ∧ ¬ p is always false, it is a contradiction
